<h1> RaspEye </h1>

<ul>
<li>This app allows to view a video stream generated by a Raspberry Pi (or any TCP transmitting device) on an iOS device. Both the iOS Device and the transmitter must be connected to the same network in order to operate.</li>
<li>"RPi Camera Viewer" App (an open source project) was used for the communication source code. (http://frozen.ca/rpi-camera-viewer-for-ios/) I simplified the app so that more beginner users can understand the project thoroughly.</li>
